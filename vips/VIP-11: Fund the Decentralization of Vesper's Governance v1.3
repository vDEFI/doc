VIP: Fund a newly created, siloed multi-sig controlled wallet - hereafter titled "DeGov" - responsible for "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*".

Summary
Allocate a portion of VSP tokens from Vesper's reserve pool to the specific purpose of "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" and have said VSP tokens be controlled by "*non top-level*" community members.

Abstract
Vesper is currently governed by a multi-sig (and a couple of siloed multi-sigs: Opcomm and Community Marketing) controlled predominantly by founding members and early team leaders/advisors. The goal of Vesper is to transition governance control completely into the hands of the community, 100% DAO.

This VIP introduces funding to be used specifically for the decentralization of Vesper's governance, by directing a small portion of the reserve pool to fund governance decentralizing initiatives.

Expectations
This proposal greenlights the allocation of 15,000 VSP tokens from the reserve pool to be used to fund governance decentralizing initiatives.

A cohort of 3 - 5 "*non top-level*" Vesper community members - vDEFI, jeffthebaker, etc - will control a newly created, siloed multi-sig wallet containing 15,000 VSP sent from Vesper's reserve pool, and will have the responsibility and authority to allocate said funds in the pursuit of "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" as they see fit, needing only a majority of the 3 - 5 cohort members approval to mobilize funds.  (The cohort will seek and heavily consider community input, but will not need to pass on-chain vVSP governance voting to mobilize funds.)

    The cohort may allocate VSP tokens to a wide range of initiatives, the following are examples of initiatives eligible to be funded by the cohort: 1) A VIP proposal from a community member benefitting the decentralization of Vesper's governance (VSP tokens may be awarded both as funding to implement the governance decentralizing changes outlined in the VIP as well as a small bounty for the contributors of the VIP.), 2) The hiring of a third-party to audit Vesper's tokenomics in an effort to find ways to increase decentralization, 3) Research, development, proposal, and/or implementation efforts done by a cohort member(s) beneficial to the decentralization of Vesper's governance, 4) etc, 5) etc. 

The cohort will NOT receive base compensation, but IS eligible to be awarded VSP tokens on the merit of their individual contributions.

The initial cohort will serve as signers for the initial epoch, a period lasting 12 months (beginning on the day **BOTH** the following requirements are met: this VIP is approved by vVSP on-chain governance voting **AND** the wallet is seeded with 15,000 VSP), during which time new members may be added to the cohort and/or residing members may be removed from the cohort pending majority vote of the residing cohort. At the conclusion of the 12 month epoch, a vVSP on-chain governance vote will occur to either "YES" - maintain the current multi-sig or "NO" - Dissolve the multi-sig and return the remaining VSP tokens to the reserve pool. Such a vote will occur at the end of every epoch. There will be no restrictions on the number of epochs (consecutive or otherwise) a cohort member may serve as a signer.

The funding requirements necessary to completely transition Vesper's governance from where it is today to a sustainable and efficient 100% community controlled DAO most likely exceeds the initial allocation of 15,000 VSP tokens, thus it is the intention to likely increase the funding to this wallet in the future - either in the form of increased allocation from the reserve pool, redirecting revenue generated by the Vesper platform, or a combination of both. The residing cohort may appeal - at any time - to the main Vesper multi-sig requesting additional funds to be sent from the reserve pool to the DeGov wallet. A vVSP on-chain governance vote is required to redirect revenue generated by the Vesper platform to the DeGov wallet.

Specification
At present Vesper is governed by a multi-sig (and a couple of siloed multi-sigs: Opcomm and Community Marketing) controlled predominantly by the founders and early team leaders/advisors.  After this VIP is accepted by the community, a new siloed Vesper multi-sig wallet used for "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" will be created and funded with 15,000 VSP tokens sent from the reserve pool, controlled by "*non top-level*" community members which will be the first significant example of ***VSP community tokens being controlled by the community, outside of the founders control!*** ðŸ¤“
