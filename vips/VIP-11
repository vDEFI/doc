VIP: Fund a bounty program for governance decentralizing VIP's
Summary
Allocate a portion of VSP tokens from Vesper's reserve pool to fund a bounty program incentivizing governance decentralizing VIP's.

Abstract
Vesper is currently governed by a multi-sig of predominantly founding members.  The goal of Vesper is to transition governance control completely into the hands of the community.

This VIP introduces a monetary incentive for the decentralizing of Vesper's governance, by directing a small portion of the reserve pool to fund a bounty program for governance decentralizing VIP's.

Expectations
This proposal greenlights the allocation of 15,000 VSP from the reserve pool to be used to fund a bounty program incentivizing governance decentralizing VIP's.

Vesper's multi-sig will be in control of the 15,000 VSP and will have the responsibility to award the funds of the bounty program - following community input.

This VIP is the initial effort to monetarily incentivize the decentralization of Vesper's governance and it is the intention to likely increase the funding to this bounty program to a higher number in the future.

Specification
At present Vesper is governed by a multi-sig controlled predominantly by the founders.  After this VIP is accepted by the community, the effort to decentralize Vesper's governance will be monetarily incentivized with a 15,000 VSP bounty program - controlled by the multi-sig, hastening Vesper's transition from multi-sig governance to a DAO.
