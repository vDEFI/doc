VIP: Fund a newly created, siloed multi-sig controlled wallet responsible for "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*".

Summary
Allocate a portion of VSP tokens from Vesper's reserve pool to the specific purpose of "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" and have said VSP tokens be controlled by "*non top-level*" community members.

Abstract
Vesper is currently governed by a multi-sig (and a couple of siloed multi-sigs: Opcomm and Community Marketing) controlled predominantly by founding members and early team leaders/advisors. The goal of Vesper is to transition governance control completely into the hands of the community, 100% DAO.

This VIP introduces funding to be used specifically for the decentralization of Vesper's governance, by directing a small portion of the reserve pool to fund governance decentralizing initiatives.

Expectations
This proposal greenlights the allocation of 15,000 VSP tokens from the reserve pool to be used to fund governance decentralizing initiatives.

A cohort of 3 - 5 "*non top-level*" Vesper community members - vDEFI, jeffthebaker, etc - will control a newly created, siloed multi-sig wallet containing 15,000 VSP sent from Vesper's reserve pool, and will have the responsibility and authority to allocate said funds in the pursuit of "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" as they see fit, needing only a majority of the 3 - 5 cohort members approval to mobilize funds.  (The cohort will seek and heavily consider community input, but will not need to pass on-chain vVSP governance voting to mobilize funds.)

The initial cohort will serve as signers for the initial epoch, a period lasting 6 months (beginning on the day **BOTH** the following requirements are met: this VIP is approved by vVSP on-chain governance voting **AND** the wallet is seeded with 15,000 VSP), after the initial epoch a vVSP on-chain governance vote will occur to elect the signers of the siloed multi-sig for the next 6 month epoch. The cohort members of the initial epoch will be eligible to be re-elected and there will be no restrictions on the number of epochs (consecutive or otherwise) a cohort member may serve as a signer.

The funding requirements necessary to completely transition Vesper's governance from where it is today to a sustainable and efficient 100% community controlled DAO most likely exceeds the initial allocation of 15,000 VSP tokens, thus it is the intention to likely increase the funding to this wallet in the future - either in the form of increased allocation from the reserve pool, redirecting revenue generated by the Vesper platform, or a combination of both.

Specification
At present Vesper is governed by a multi-sig (and a couple of siloed multi-sigs: Opcomm and Community Marketing) controlled predominantly by the founders and early team leaders/advisors.  After this VIP is accepted by the community, a new siloed Vesper multi-sig wallet used for "*Advancing the decentralization of Vesper's governance and accelerating the transition of Vesper's governance to a DAO*" will be created and funded with 15,000 VSP tokens sent from the reserve pool, controlled by "*non top-level*" community members which will be the first significant example of ***VSP community tokens being controlled by the community, outside of the founders control!*** ðŸ¤“
